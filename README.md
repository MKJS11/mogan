# Mogan STEM

Mogan STEM is a professional scientific writing platform targeted at mathematics, physics, statistics, and computer science, specially designed to handle complex formula-based documents. It is deeply optimized from [GNU TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/), with emphasis on performance and user experience. With Mogan STEM you can create scientific documents up to 100x faster than with $\LaTeX$.
